## Overview

This project is used to deploy Trojan Websocket protocol on Replit free service.

Support WS-0RTT to reduce latency, Xray core client can be enabled by adding ?ed=2048 after the Websocket path.

## Notice

 **Do not abuse, account ban is at your own risk. Free accounts have a monthly limit of 10GB of internet traffic. **
 
 **Old Android device certificates cannot be updated. If you cannot connect, you can try to open and skip certificate verification**

## deployment
 
 **It is no longer possible to deploy directly from this repository. **

 1. Click Fork in the upper right corner of this warehouse, and then click Create Fork.   
 2. Click Setting on the warehouse page that comes out of the Fork, and check Template repository.   
 3. Then click Code to return to the previous page, click the newly-appeared button Use this template under Setting, and create a new library with a random name.  
 4. Be careful not to include keywords such as `vmess` and `trojan` in the project name (use `example` for the user name, and `demo` for the modified project name)  
 5. After logging in to Replit, visit https://repl.it/github/example/demo with your browser, and click Import from Github.

### One-click automatic deployment

Click Run at the top of the webpage, wait for a while and the deployment is complete, and the console window on the right will automatically output the sharing link and QR code, which can be scanned with the v2rayn/v2rayng client.

Trojan passwords and Websocket paths are randomly generated and stored in the Repl database.
